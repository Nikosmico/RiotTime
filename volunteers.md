### **The Community Garden of Help** 🌱

**Welcome to our garden!** Here, we grow kindness by helping each other. Every time you help someone, you plant a seed. Later, you can pick a fruit when you need help yourself.



### **How Our Garden Grows** 🌻

Think of it like a friendly plant swap between neighbors!

**When you help someone, you plant a "Seed of Help."** 🌱
> *"Thanks for helping me fix my bike! Here's a 'Seed' to thank you."*

**When you need help, you pick a "Fruit of Thanks."** 🍎
> *"I'd love some help with my resume. I'm picking a 'Fruit' to ask for it."*



### **The Simple Rule of the Garden**

**For every 1 help you give → you get 1 help you can receive.**

It’s not a coin or a point—it’s a little promise from our community that your kindness will be returned.

*   **Help a friend set up their phone** → **+1 Seed** 🌱
*   **Spend an hour tutoring** → **+1 Seed** 🌱
*   **Need help moving a couch** → **-1 Fruit** 🍎
*   **Want feedback on your project** → **-1 Fruit** 🍎



### **What Your Garden Shows:**

Your personal "garden" shows a simple count:
*   **Seeds Planted:** How many times you've helped others.
*   **Fruits Available:** How many helps you can receive right now.

It’s a beautiful, living record of the good you’ve put into the community!

*This isn't a points system—it's a friendship system. We all have something to give, and we all need a little help sometimes.* 💝
