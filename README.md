# RiotTime ðŸ•’

**A platform where people can donate their time â€” both locally and remotely â€” to help others in their community.**

## Overview

RiotTime is a community-driven platform that connects volunteers with people who need help through both in-person tasks and online support. Our mission is to empower people to give the gift of time, creating meaningful connections across local and digital communities.
