# RiotTime 🕒

**A platform where people can donate their time — both locally and remotely — to help others in their community.**

---

## 🧭 What is RiotTime?

RiotTime is a **community-driven platform** that connects volunteers with people who need help — whether it's **in-person tasks** like grocery shopping or home repairs, or **online help** like tutoring, resume reviews, or digital support.

Our mission is to empower people to give the gift of time, no matter where they or the person in need are located.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To create a **global network of volunteers** who can offer their time and skills to help others — both **in their local communities** and **online** — in a safe, transparent, and meaningful way.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Someone posts a request**:  
   - *"I need help fixing my bike."*  
   - *"Can someone help me learn how to use Excel?"*  
   - *"I’m isolated and just need someone to talk to."*

2. **Volunteers view the request** and choose to help.

3. **They coordinate directly** — either in person or online — and complete the task or support.
